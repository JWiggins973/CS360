## Reflection üìù
### **Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The requirements for the project were to create an inventory management application that allows the user to login. Once user credentials are verified the user should see a list of all current inventory items with real time accurate count. In addition to viewing the inventory, the user can also perform CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete items from the inventory database. Finally, the application should ask for SMS permissions and if granted the user will recieve low inventory alerts as well as being displayed in the notification center.

### **What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens needed to support the user needs are the login screen, the home screen and the notification screen. My UI design keep users in my by labeling each screen with a title so the user knows what screen they are currently on at all times, I also gave the inventory list column labels to easily identify what was being displayed. I believe my design choices were sucessful becuase it didnt over complicated the project and the application is simple with easily identifiable icons that even non technical users can figure out.

### **How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached desgning viewing apps that have a similair use case and planning out how i should design mine layout wise. Once the layout was decided I created each screen that was needed.
### **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

### **Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

### **In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
