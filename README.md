## Reflection üìù
### **Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

### **What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

### **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

### **Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

### **In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
